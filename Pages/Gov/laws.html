         <h1>Hillside Village Township Laws</h1>
         <p>10 Jan. 2020</p>
         <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
            <p>For the record, Hillside© is copyrighted. This is the 2020 version of the laws and regulations for Hillside Township and, subsequently, the HOA(RC). Document and legal rights subject to change at any time for any reason. Any changes that will jeopardize the future editing of this document needs the support of every single HOA member, a unanimous vote. Issues may be brought up with the secretary or person in charge of that particular field. Sarcasm is the official language of Hillside and is always encouraged. Glish, on the other hand, is fully and thoroughly banned. Any speak of it shall be a week’s sentence. All citizens must read this paper at least once per quarter.</p>
            <h2>LAND USAGE</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>Land may be granted by agreement of officials with the plot surveyed by the contractor and request applied for by the citizen in question. The applicant will receive a copy of the certificate and the other copy will be put in the Binder.</li>
               <li>Land may be used for the reasons of storage or housing, and one person or group can only hold one plot for personal benefit/use.</li>
               <li>Community structures can be suggested to the Architect and approved by the HOA(RC)(Hillside Owners Association(Residents Committee)).</li>
               <li>Construction of a new building can be a community activity and  citizens should be allowed to help unless the builder(s) do not want them to.</li>
               <li>A map of all plots and ownership must be kept in the Record Binder and updated by the Architect under every mayor.</li>
               <li>The destruction or reconstruction of a building must be unanimously voted on by the HOA.</li>
               <li>All houses will be inspected by the Mayor and/or their Second-in-Command weekly.</li>
               <li>If citizens wants to design their own house they must seek permission from the HOA</li>
               <li>All land belongs to the HOA and will be distributed at their command.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>LAW SYSTEM</h2>
            <p>The Hillside justice system is composed of the following; the Mayor and HOA, the Judge, and the Lawyers. A Lawyer is not needed but strongly advised by the government officials, who I can’t promise were not bribed by the lawyers (hey, it was a good deal). This brings me to bribes. Bribes are accepted in any way, shape or form, but ONLY government officials can ‘legally’ accept them. The judge runs all cases in the HCC and the HOA meetings. If any rule below has been broken, it instantly becomes a case to be investigated by the Police.</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Robbing the property of fellow citizens.</li>
               <li>Breaking and entering any building without the consent of the owner. This rule may only be broken by the Police, Firefighter,  Mayor, and Second in Command.</li>
               <li>Tricking someone to your advantage.</li>
               <li>Bloody or non-bloody murder (icicle-suggested technique).</li>
               <li>Cold blooded murder.</li>
               <li>Murder without incentive or reason.</li>
               <li>Destroying or sabotaging others’ work.</li>
               <li>Mutilation of each other.</li>
               <li>Yeeting items of importance.</li>
               <li>Entering areas closed to construction.</li>
               <li>Tax fraud and money laundering.</li>
               <li>Biting, scratching, kicking, snatching.</li>
               <li>Abuse in general (keep it vague).</li>
               <li>Freedom, liberty, and justice for the peasants.</li>
               <li>Fake Candy and Fake Fruit.</li>
               <li>Rotten joy.</li>
               <li>Managing to contain the 2019-NoCv.</li>
               <li>Breaking treaties of any kind.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The Judge may decide aquadate punishment for each crime. Your criminal records will be kept by the Police officer FOREVER. These rules are in effect throughout Hillside.</p>
            <h2>CURRENCY</h2>
            <ol>
               <li>Type and value of the object of monetary value must be universally agreed upon.</li>
               <li>Money laundering and taxation is unnecessary when not and therefore illegal business.</li>
               <li>Trade is applicable when both sides are in mutual agreement.</li>
               <li>Any major exchange must be known and approved by the Mayor/HOA.</li>
               <li>Small trades or purchases at the market do not have to be approved.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>HILLSIDE COMMUNITY CENTER </h2>
            <p>The Hillside Community Center (HCC) is the town hall and is used for community HOA meetings, votes, and is home to the Court, Fire station and Police station. The building must be booked for resident activities such as performances, classes, bible readings, etc. Classes can be monetized. The HCC is also the multi-religion center and the office for the HOA.</p>
            <h2>MAYOR AND OFFICEHOLDERS</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>Mayor’s term is one quarter of the school year, or one science and humanities.</li>
               <li>Mayor is nominated and voted for by citizens and cannot hold office for more than two terms. Any one with two or more felonies on their criminal record can not become Mayor. The Judge decides what qualifies as a felony.</li>

               <li>Any Mayor or SiC may be imnectarined by unanimous vote, give or take one.</li>
               <li>The HOA consists of the Mayor, Second in Command and five HOA volunteers.</li>
               <li>The HOA volunteers are voted for every year. They must be eighth graders.</li>
               <li>The HOA votes one week before the common community.</li>
               <li>The elections run for two weeks, with a speech per week from each candidate on Monday.</li>
               <li>The HOA votes the first week, and the common peasants the next week.</li>
               <li>The votes are announced by the Mayor the day his or her term ends.</li>
               <li>The previous Mayor shall advise the new Mayor for the first three weeks of their term.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>IMNECTARINEING</h2>
            <p>A Mayor or Second-in-Command can be imnectarined by unanimous vote. Imnectarineing is to vote a leader out of office. It should not be a hassle and should not take more than one week. It can only be done with good proof and reason.</p>
            <h2>HOA </h2>
            <p>The HOA consists of citizen volunteers and the Mayor, unless it is chosen to have members be voted on by the public every quarter of a year. They are responsible for the following:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Important decisions that affect the community as a whole.</li>
               <li>Giving land to citizens.</li>
               <li>Accepting designs given by the Architect.</li>
               <li>Major interactions</li>
               <li>Giving certificates of ownership</li>
               <li>Giving materials to builders</li>
               <li>Distributing unneeded artifacts</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>OUTSIDERS</h2>
            <p>Any outsiders who enter the Hillside borders must follow all the Hillside laws, including punishment if necessary. If they refuse or bother the citizens doing their daily jobs, they could get PERMANENTLY BANISHED.</p>
            <h2>EXPANSION</h2>
            <p>   Hillside must eventually expand, one of the places being the bamboo forest by the road. If a section of Hillside is built there, it will follow the Hillside Mayor, not its own leader. It shall not become the center of Hillside, and no important buildings like the HCC or the WSM will be moved there. If any Hillside citizens do make their own community with their own leader they shall be banished. The vote of the HOA is not needed.</p>
            <h2>WHACKING STICK MUSEUM</h2>
            <p>The Whacking Stick Museum(WSM) is responsible for keeping records and teaching people Hillside’s history. The Historian organizes the history books and the old Mayor’s books using the Dewey Decimal System. The museum also owns all artifacts and displays them to the public. Any artifacts of high value, historical significance, any glass, and metal found instantly belong to the museum. It is the workspace of the Historian/ Librarian. The Historian may grant a lesser artifact to a person with good cause and payment. Plastic of lesser importance (eg. Dasani disposable plastic water bottles—Mmm...Dasani (paid promotion)) may be kept by the finder, but anything else instantly belongs to the Whacking Stick Museum. This is also the Library, where the record books are kept. Records of projects, history of officeholders, or any major changes should be documented in the record binder of the appropriate year. The HOA will reimburse the finder for a sign if an artifact, if found hidden and not on government property. No one is to keep artifacts in their house unless given permission by the Historian. Government jars are given to finders of artifacts.</p>
            <h2>GOVERNMENT JARS</h2>
            <p>Government jars are to be given to people by the government  in exchange for finding WSM artifacts. No one house should have more than three government jars, except the Healer(s).</p>
            <h2>SUPPLY SHED</h2>
            <p>The supply shed holds sticks, logs, vines, stones, tools, food, and clothes. It is the working place of the Blacksmith/Carver and the Resupplier/Distributor and/or other applicable jobs. Government jars are kept here. Materials are carried here by the criminals.</p>
            <h2>SENTENCES</h2>
            <p>When a criminal has been sentenced, instead of imprisoning them the criminal shall be made do unsavory jobs, such as carrying wood to the storage shed from the pile and carrying materials to construction sites. A criminal can be made to do anything as long as it is agreed on by the HOA. Community projects are an idea for a sentence. If the criminal stays inside that does not count as a day.</p>
            <h2>BUILDING SAFETY</h2>
            <p>All buildings in Hillside must follow these standards:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Roof (optional)</li>
               <li>Minimum of three walls</li>
               <li>Sturdy structure</li>
               <li>More than four main branches holding up the structure</li>
               <li>Permit</li>
               <li>Certificate of ownership</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>CONFLICTS</h2>
            <p>In times of war all citizens of Hillside must stick together and defend Hillside. Provoking war is severely punishable. Any traitors shall be banished after trial. The weapons officer shall run all battle preparations such as fortification and keeping stock of weapons. The Police and SiC are the Generals.</p>
            <h2>COMMUNITY PROJECTS </h2>
            <p>Community projects may be proposed to the HOA. If the majority agree the effort would be worthwhile the HOA will fund the project. If the project is rejected by the HOA it may not continue/start. The idea may be resubmitted under a different mayor.</p>
            <h2>HOLIDAYS</h2>
            <p>A list of holidays when everyone, even criminals take a break. There are to be no HOA meetings.</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Market day; every Thursday</li>
             <li>Creation day;</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>MARKET</h2>
            <p>Market day is Thursday, when citizens sell things they have found, made, or grown. Market plots must be booked at least a week before. There are to be no meetings on Market day. Market day is a day off for every one, including minor criminals fulfilling their sentences. </p>
            <h2>CLASSES</h2>
            <p>Classes such as yoga or kung-fu may be held in the Whacking Stick Museum, with HOA permission or on the teacher’s property (house or yard). If the activity is of hazardous nature, such as axe-throwing, along with HOA permission, lessons should be held somewhere safe. Remember to sign up in the records binder or on the town bulletin. In times of war, veterans (like yours truly) can teach fighting and such with government supplied weapons.</p>
            <h2> JOBS</h2>
            <p>Everyone needs a job. If someone is not doing their job they can have the job withdrawn by the HOA. They can talk to the Mayor about what they want to do. He/she can advise whichever job he/she thinks will suit the person. There can be multiple people having the same job, and citizens may have more than one job (excluding the Mayor). The HOA must approve the job and applicant before duty. The person who wishes to apply for a job must know something about it, have had previous experience with the job they wish to have, or be trained by someone who has previous experience. If a citizen has a new job they may suggest it to the HOA for acceptance or denial. If a citizen is not doing their job, the HOA has every right to fire them. The following jobs are available for the citizens of Hillside:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Firefighter: Oversees the safety of the people and their homes. Checks that all buildings follow government safety standards.</li>

               <li>Second In Command/Secretary: Does the work the mayor does not have time for but has to be done. He/she takes the mayor's place if they are gone, having two votes in HOA meetings. The Second in command can do most of the mayor’s jobs, (ex: documenting major trades) along with their own jobs, such as checking houses weekly. They may not decide important things like the destruction or reconstruction of a building or giving certificates of land ownership to citizens. This must be done by the official mayor. There can only be one secretary, who is chosen by the Mayor.</li>
               <li>Contractor: It is the contractors job to approve the location of any building or construction. If anyone starts to construct a building without permission from the HOA, the contractor, mayor, or architect, the lawbreaker will be put on trial and the people will decide the consequence for the lawbreaker. The contractor is also responsible for the safety of the house and the location. If any harm comes to the house/the people who are in the house at the time, the contractor will be subject to the responsibility of that inconvenience.</li>
