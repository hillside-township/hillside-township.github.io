            <h3>Hillside Will Open Soon, With Proper COVID-19 Precautions!</h3>
            <p>Starting August 19, 2020 Y.D.(Year of Dispair) Hillside shall open up once again! However, we must ask you to follow certain saftey procedures. Mask wearing, sanitation, and ritual ceremonies shall be put into action along with other WHO suggested safty techniques. Remember that all these precautioins are are put into place for the safty of you and your fellow Hillside citizens, and to ensure that I don't get sick and die. My demise would be a major loss to the community, for then who would write these news articles? Well, I suppose the Assistant Editor and all the interns, but they are not yet fully ready, and have not yet earned their sarcasm certificates. Until they are ready, just please keep safe and make sure that our beloved town will survive throught these hard times.</p>

            <h1>Cat Meows at Tall Grass</h1>
            <h3>Can the precious grass be saved?</h3>
            <p>The prestigious math Professor Radical Numburrs was taking his early morning stroll when he saw his neighbor’s cat meowing at the town’s only prized clump of real grass. And even worse, the cat, Mister Meowzworth, NIBBLED A BIT OF THE GRASS! This coming Tuesday the Chief Police, ****** ********, is going to put Mister Meowzworth on trial for this unforgivable infringement of the law. Currently, all the police are busy thinking of how to punish Mister Meowzworth since the usual method does not apply for cats. They are thinking of something along the lines some years in prison, but the trouble is he might slip through the bars. Meanwhile Hillside has hired the world’s greatest botanist to see if they can heal the precious clump of grass.</p>

            <h1>New Plant Discovered</h1>
            <h3>High Economic Value</h3>
            <p>Explorer Awsum Diskcovries found a new plant when adventuring in the jungles of Hillside. He describes it as; “Big. Kinda Green. Big. Planty. Did I say big?” The best part about this plant is not its square leaves, or roots that grow along a grid. It is the fruit. This new plant, called the Wait..what? tree  has pakoras as fruit. Many people are sceptical, but as proof Awsum Diskcovries took a potted plant to the Pope, who now firmly believes in the plant. This could be great for the economy, but it might completely dislodge the chickpea, spinach, and spices businesses. Chickpea, spinach, and spices farmers are having riots claiming that the tree should be banned. Hillside botanist Photo Snthasis says this is going to be awesome. “This is great! This proves my theory that we can grow processed foods! In a couple of years we can hybridize it to stretch to all fried food! Imagine, going into  your backyard and picking and eating fresh fries straight off the tree!” This may sound a bit optimistic, but many other botanists agree. One day we might be eating fried food straight off a tree. Just imagine that. Healthy people aren't going to be happy. I’m not a healthy person.</p>

            <h1>Really Quite Old Paper Found</h1>
            <h3>Major Historic Discoveries</h3>
            <p>A really old document was found in the Hillside area by math professor Radical Numburrs. After three weeks of no sleep, during which scientists sat trying to decode it, Radical Numburrs walked in and flipped the paper, thus ‘decoding’ the paper. After spending quite a bit of money carbon dating it, Radical Numburrs found the date written at the top of the paper, 3.1415 B.Y.E. (Before Y’all Existed), making this paper the oldest sign of sentience in existence. Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly when that was. Historians favor the idea that the paper was written “rather quite a while ago, old chap.” Historian Loang Agoe says “This will lead the way to major historic discoveries. *cough* *cough* I just have a common cold, that’s all. Nothing serious. *cough* *cough* Anyway, this paper could teach us things about the past we never could have learned otherwise.” read more about this document in the next edition of this newspaper.</p>

            <h1>Hillside- A Town of the Past?</h1>
            <h3>The newly founded town, will it recover?</h3>
            <p>Everyone knows that Hillside is extremely new, as of the beginning of this year. Hillside had an extremely good start, and it’s population was about nine citizens in total. As Hillside developed more citizens and started jobs and more buildings, other outsiders grew jealous. Eventually, the Blank Nation formed, and a Cold War broke out. Friendships grew stale, and promises and trusts were broken. After some debate and many arguments, everything was settled and Hillside even made a pact, along with developing a trading and supply route with them in return for sticks and rocks. But then, just as Hillside had regrown its roots, people started abandoning Hillside just as the new Mayor, ****** ******* was elected into office. But that's not all. After that, the newly discovered virus named Covid-19 struck, forcing all citizens from every Nation to abandon their homes and go to their legit home at their home. During this time, weather changed, storms hit, wind blew down houses, and plants regrew.</p>

            <h1>Really Quite Old Paper Dicipered</h1>
            <h3>Major Historic Discoveries</h3>
            <p>If you have read the last part of this article, you will know that Radical Numburrs found an old paper in the Hillside area. The researchers have managed to decipher an amount of the paper and are amazed by their findings. “This could totally revolutionize the baby food industry.” Says one researcher, Findings Tufout. By wandering around the research facility, I discovered a great many things, only some of which I shall be revealing now.</p>

            <h1>What Happens to Broken News</h1>
            <h3>The newly founded town, will it recover?</h3>
            <p>Always on the front page of a newspaper is the outstanding or breaking news. Now, after the news has finished breaking, what does it do? Where does it go? Researchers have been working on this for maybe two months and they are finally getting results. Using some shifty tactics, none of which were released to the press, they managed to make a breaking news article about a researcher, and send him to the place where broken news goes. By some other even more shifty tactics they summoned him back to this universe. Apart from only speaking in poetry, he seems to be fine. So far what we have gathered from him is this:</p>
            <i>The place where lost things go,<br>There there are things you once did know,<br>A lone sock,<br>A missing book,<br>That eraser you thought your brother took,<br>All the things that you misplaced,<br>Things you said had gone away,<br>Whisked off into space,<br>And others laughed to your dismay,<br>But worry not,<br>For you were right,<br>They were taken in the night,<br>Taken to a far-away land,<br>Hidden from the sight of man,<br>It is called, if you must know,<br>The Place where Lost Things Go,<br>So if there’s something you can’t find,<br>Always, always keep in mind,<br>It has gone to the hidden place,<br>The Place Where Lost Things Go.</i>
            <p>These results are much more interesting than expected. It also gave the answers of another research being conducted at the same institute, Hillside’s Research Institute for Unimportant Problems, which was trying to find where missing items went. Altogether the research was very successful, and must just hope that the scientist who went to the place where lost things go shall recover from the unfortunate side effects.</p>

            <h1>Trilobite Park Opening</h1>
            <h3>Grand Opening May 12</h3>
            <p>The town scientist, John Hammond, after a horribly publicized  crushing defeat in trying to bring back dinosaurs, had settled down in Hillside for retirement. He was pulled out of retirement by the discovery of a bit of fossilized trilobite DNA in the Hillside area.He has decided to go back to the drawing board, and after nearly two years Trilobite Park is ready to open. The first two months are already completely booked, and thousands are flocking to Hillside to see what scientists call ‘our oldest ancestors’. It’s great for local business, and many small businesses are thriving. All those places that sell useless tourist stuff like postcards and plastic thingamajobs are suddenly getting customers. The government, who has been trying to put them out of business for years, is still sulking. Local hotels are also doing well. “Business is booming, and I've finally got enough money to buy that mansion with 90 billion acres. It’s great, just the people who stay in my hotel complain about the lack of restrooms. I mean, really, who needs those?” Says the owner of Hillsides’ biggest hotel, the Welcome Inn (pun most definitely intended), Mr. Eurar Wolcome. I'm just saying that I’m not going until they make sure the Jurassic Park incident does not reoccur...</p>

            <h1>Hillside’s Museum Collapses!</h1>
            <h3>Can we fix it?</h3>
            <p>The newly under construction building we all knew as the Whacking Stick Museum has collapsed! Workers have inspected the wreckage and discovered the cause of this mass destruction; weather and wind. The destruction is fatal, and the head of building, Squirrel, and his moderation team are still discussing the options. To fix it, they would need a lot more supplies and material, which is starting to get scarce, due to the new towns in the area. Another obstacle in the way of the continuation of building is the Covid-19 virus that has immobilised schools and forced people to stay inside. If construction would continue, it would not start until the fall of 2020. This is a huge hit on Hillside, and we might not recover from this devastating blow.  “It’s just truly horrible.” says chief of construction Squirrel. The town Mayor, ****** ******* is notified of this and is trying to find a solution to this problem as fast as possible, but with the summer approaching fast, it’s clear that Hillside may never recover. </p>

            <h1>A Wall For War?</h1>
            <h3>Are the neighboring towns proposing war?</h3>
            <p>When Hillside went into quarantine the bordering towns started the construction of a wall, some of which cut off important archeological digging sites and even the house of our esteemed Mayor. Some are taking this as a sign of war, and wish to fight to get back the land. Others suppose a more friendly approach by asking our neighbors for the reason for this obvious disrespect of boundary lines.  During the construction of this wall, the neighbors demolished the new mayor's  house; all that remains of it are a few bits of sticks and rocks, and the area is still a circle from the foundation of the house. Even though we are working for peace, the mayor has reluctantly agreed to start training villagers in the art of defense, disregarding the fact that Hillside is a supposedly ‘peaceful’ town. “If the time comes, we have to fight back!” Says Chief of Police and Official Maintainer of the Armory. “We need our people to be ready for everything. Hillside must survive no matter the odds, for if we do not strive to survive, we shall not.” Says Squirrel, Hillside founder and factotum.</p>

            <h3>A Virtual Hillside?</h3>
            <p>It may seem to outsiders that Hillside is in a decline, and shall soon fall into disrepair and fade from the books of history. But fear not, for this daunting thought might never come to reality. The Hillside HOA shall be gathering to discuss the idea of a virtual Hillside. This may seem ludicrous at first, but it may be the only way to save Hillside from an otherwise inevitable fate. However, even if this comes to be a reality, Hillside will not become a completely online town. “Drastic measures must be taken in times of need,” Says the founder of Hillside, Squirrel, “but whatever the circumstances, Hillside must remain viable until we can return in person and give all our loving care to our wonderful town. If any one of you have any ideas, please find a way of contacting us.”</p>

            <h1>Mysterious Watch Towers</h1>
            <h3>From Where do These Wathchtowers Come?</h3>
            <p>	Many citizens are worried about the mysterious dark watch towers that have been erected around the edge of town. When interviewed about the watchtowers, the HOA stated that they were there to protect Hillside from the dark creatures that prowl the surrounding forest at night. They did not bother to explain how over twenty towers were built in a single night. Another important thing they could have explained are the wraiths that circle the top of the towers. The wraiths are wreathed in a shroud of darkness that causes all in it’s reach to fall into utmost despair, and occasionally chant  in some unknown language consisting of blood curdling screams that causes an irrational bone-chilling fear. The chief of the secret police reassures inhabitants that “There is no need to worry, as long as you DO NOT APPROACH THE TOWERS. For extra safety, keep your children indoors if you have not given a satisfactory sacrifice to the wraiths.” So there, readers, there is no threat from these watchtowers, as long as you continue to pay your taxes and have voted right in the last election. What a relief. I’m sure that in no time these watchtowers will become an important contributing part of our town.</p>
